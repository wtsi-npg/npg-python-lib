class ParseError(Exception):
    """Raised when a configuration file cannot be parsed."""

    pass


class IniData:
    """A configuration class that reads values from an INI file to create an instance of
    a specified dataclass. Using a dataclass results in configuration that is easier
    to understand and more maintainable than using a bare dictionary because all its
    fields are explicitly defined. This means that they are readable, navigable and
    autocomplete-able in an IDE, can have default values, and can have docstrings.

    E.g. given an INI file 'config.ini':

        [server]
        host = localhost
        port = 9000

    and a dataclass:

        @dataclass
        class ServerConfig:
            host: str
            port: str

    the following code will create a new instance obj of the dataclass where
    host='localhost' and port='9000':

       parser = IniData(ServerConfig)
       obj = parser.from_file("config.ini", "server")

    If the 'use_env' flag is set, the configuration will fall back to an environment
    variable if the INI file does not contain a value for that field. The default
    environment variable name is the field name in upper case. As the shell environment
    lacks the context of an enclosing dataclass, the default name may benefit from a
    prefix to make it more descriptive. This can be provided by using the 'env_prefix'
    argument.

    E.g. given an INI file 'config.ini':

        [server]
        host = localhost

    with an environment variable 'SERVER_PORT' set to '9001' and the same dataclass as
    above, the following code will create a new instance obj of the dataclass where
    host='localhost' and port='9001':

        parser = IniData(ServerConfig, use_env=True, env_prefix="SERVER_").
        obj = from_file("config.ini", "server")

    All values are treated as strings.

    The class provides INFO level logging of its actions to enable loading of
    configurations to be traced.

    If your dataclass includes sensitive information, you should take care to ensure
    that the fields are not logged. This can be done by declaring the field with
    metadata:

        @dataclass
        class ServerConfig:
            admin-token: str = field(repr=False)
    """

    def __init__(self, cls: D, use_env: bool = False, env_prefix: str = ""):
        """Makes a new configuration instance which can create instances of the
        dataclass 'D'.

        Args:
            cls: A dataclass to bind to this configuration.
            use_env: If True, fall back to environment variables if a value is not found
                in an INI file. Defaults to False. The environment variable used to
                supply a missing field's value is the field name in upper case
                (prefixed with env_prefix, if provided).
            env_prefix: A prefix to add to the name of any environment variable used as
                a fallback. Defaults to "". The prefix is folded to upper case.
                Dataclass field names exist in the context of their class. However,
                environment variables exist in a global context and can benefit from a
                more descriptive name. The prefix can be used to provide that.
